Meeting notes Paul DAvy & Tim Purkiss
https://ucldata.atlassian.net/browse/CIO-3834

How will it be triggered?

Identity answer - We know when people leave but... just a change of status.



State of being but not a affirmation can be deleted. AD groups - Time period after to account user has left (Andy Glass has OU's with membership state 30/90/180/270/365) - driven by o365

Identify team have Trigger for group accoutn status (not published outside ID team)

Envisaged: an event to state account has "change aged" or can be "deleted". This will be in a format to be created. (not made yet).

o365 has a deletion + x days before soft delete becomes hard delete

2 states:
- someone has left AD groups
- Deletion process under review / dev to kill user account (ISD CP to plug into this as trigger) in progress. CP can delete N drive when AD account is officially killed.

 

Blockers to be tested / signed off

Cant just kill AD account: Reason, this would leaver orphan objects in associated systems example (HR / Fin) which would not tidy up (WIP)

Does associated systems manage the deletion of accounts or leave issues ie. reporting on data linked to ex-user / object / account

Timescale

Pilot this term pending resources (TBC)

40k accounts to tidy up (crica)

 

Short term actions

a list of accounts could be provided as a 1 off exercise in Ti4/1

 

Retention / Policy

Data retention policy - is needed. eg. if 1 > year then we (ISD CP) can use account closure data / departed data + 365 as figure. (allows a safety buffer fir time

What are user's told to avoid breach of any (perceived) contract

If person returns > retention period and demands data we need to be converted for this eventuality

If no policy stated for past departed users with data remaining where do we stand. CAn we action deletion.
